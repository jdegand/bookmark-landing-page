## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

- Better Semantics.
- Web Accessibility.
- Using row-reverse could be avoided by showing and hiding duplicate html content. When refreshing, you can see the content moving.  
- Putting 'position: relative' on the first-section::before prevents the hamburger from working.
- Using ::before for the background image with absolute positioning means *all* viewport sizes must be accounted for.
- Made the mobile nav fixed.
